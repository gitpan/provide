Uh-oh, it looks like the test you're running uses
'subtest', but your version of Test::More doesn't actually
support subtest. I'm faking out a 'subtest' for you.
Please just make sure the tests pass - don't worry about
failures that are solely related to test counts.

Dang. You've tried to use 'subtest()' in a test, which is totally cool,
even on this old version of Test::More $Test::More::VERSION, which
doesn't really implement a subtest()... except it's not cool, because
you already planned your tests, and this shim needs to fake out the
plan a bit in order to convince the test harness that all is well.
And unfortunately the plan's already been written out: there's no
nice way for me to recover it.

You can either:

(a) stop using subtest();
(b) change your useline for Test::More from something like this:

    use Test::More tests => $tb->{Expected_Tests};

to something more like this:

    use Test::More; END { done_testing() }

Yeah, I'm not a fan of done_testing() either, but those are your choices.

        $tb->{Expected_Tests} += $num;
      };
      $test->();
    }

=head1 NAME

Test::Easy - a shim between Test::Easy elsewhere on the system, and what you've got

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I like good tests. I also like clean production code.

Test suites that impose installing libraries alongside production code are a special
maelstrom of values for me: on the one hand, a good test suite provides a lot of
flexibility and information; on the other, flexibility and information come at the
expense of needing to install additional CPAN libraries.

So this is my compromise. If you've got Test::Easy installed, this module will go find
it and happily delegate to the real Test::Easy.

On the other hand, if you don't have Test::Easy installed, this module will provide
a small amount of adaptation between what you don't have and what you do have.
